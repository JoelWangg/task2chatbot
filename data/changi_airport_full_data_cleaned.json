    "page_url": "https//nowboarding.changiairport.com/travel-the-world/onsens-and-ryokans-in-kyoto.html",
    "paragraphs": [
      "Because the world is too small for strangers. 28 Dec 2023 By Morgan Awyong",
      "The ancient capital of Japan, Kyoto holds its own magnetic allure against popular sister cities Tokyo and Osaka. As the bustling heart of the country during the Heian period 794-1185, Kyoto is also widely acknowledged as the cultural capital of Japan and its legacy can still be seen today in traditions such as kado the art of flower arrangement and chado tea ceremony, preserved for both the Japanese and visitors around the world.",
      "Kyoto is also home to numerous Buddhist temples, Shinto shrines, palaces and gardens - often easily accessible when walking through its streets. But when considering a Kyoto hotel, people are increasingly looking towards ryokans for a truly Japanese experience.",
      "Best described as traditional Japanese inns, ryokans are a hallmark Japanese experience because of how they have retained the customary environment, hospitality, and traditional architecture - often passed down and maintained through generations. Some of them even include attached onsen hot spring facilities - another highlight in Kyoto.",
      "While ryokans and onsens in Hakone and Kanazawa are also well-known, picking a Kyoto ryokan or onsen has benefits such as its accessibility to major airports, proximity to world-famous Kyoto attractions, as well as a plethora of options with different price points.",
      "So what should one consider when picking a Kyoto ryokan? Can you go to onsens in Kyoto without staying at a ryokan? What are some of the expected Japanese etiquette to keep in mind? Read on to find out everything you need to know about Kyotos onsens and ryokans.",
      "Ryokans had their beginnings in wayfarers - catering to passing travellers on foot, which included samurai and tradesmen moving between Tokyo and Kyoto.",
      "The first ever to appear was Nishiyama Onsen Keiunkan in 705 CE, and amazingly, is still in operation today. It remains as the oldest ryokan in Japan, and also holds the title as the longest continuously-running hotel in the world. This ryokan, along with many that followed, were built on the site of rejuvenating hot springs, which is why the pairing became somewhat synonymous. But while ryokans and onsens are sometimes used interchangeably, they are not the same.",
      "The former is an accommodation, while the latter is a natural hot spring water experience, sometimes in the form of open-air baths. Some ryokans dont have onsens, and some onsens are dedicated facilities with no overnight options. In fact, because of the therapeutic properties of hot spring water, many choose to visit standalone onsens regularly for its health benefits.",
      "A typical onsen is a communal affair, with several large sharing pools, each boasting different natural minerals and temperatures for its purported healing properties. They often come with lockers and changing rooms for both genders, and can sometimes include a restaurant or massage services on premise. Private onsen baths can be found too, but these will usually be attached to a ryokan. Travellers may also have reservations about going to private open-air baths or outdoor onsens, but rest assured that the bath will typically be surrounded by a high wall to prevent nosy onlookers.",
      "Another common point of confusion is mistaking sentos public baths for onsens. Though similar in format with their lockers and hot communal public baths, sentos are utilitarian hot baths with no natural minerals in their waters while onsens are more akin to that spa visit. They were built as early facilities for those with homes without private baths, but as time went by, owners started adding herbs, minerals and water jets as upgrades, which made them have their own benefits. Both have their fans, but be aware of which you are going to so you are not disappointed.",
      "But whether youre looking for a memorable ryokan stay or relaxing onsens in Kyoto, the cultural city is a great place to start.",
      "Ready for a ryokan? Then expect the following Overnight lodging in a private traditional Japanese-style room with tatami mat flooring mats made of woven straw, futons for sleeping comfortably on the mats, and options of breakfast and yukatas a light cotton kimono. These are typical of standard ryokans, but do know that there are many styles available as well.",
      "Some are family-run like Fujiya Ryokan, with rooms that start from S50 per pax. They boast standard Japanese innkeeper hospitality, with warm and professional staff that can point you towards the citys best offerings, as well as the charm of having a resident cat on premise.",
      "Some ryokans, like Sangen Kyoto, are reimagining the traditional inn as a gathering place for travellers to experience traditional Japanese rituals, meals, and activities. Image credit Morgan Awyong",
      "A stay at the Sangen Kyoto ryokan promises you an intimate experience in the heart of Kyotos Ninenzaka area, with opportunities to experience everything from sushi to shabu-shabu to ikebana. Image credit Morgan Awyong",
      "Others, like Sangen Kyoto, are operated by a younger generation of owners that adds a more casual vibe to their ryokans. Traditional ryokans, sometimes they have a distance between guest and host, said Shusui Tanaka, its owner. While he and his staff are passionate about sharing the traditional offerings in Kyoto - the whole reason why Tanaka ventured into hospitality after he graduated from university eight years ago - they want to approach it with less formality, and include crafted experiences that are less intimidating.",
      "Essentially, its like having local friends bring the quintessential Japanese encounters to your doorstep. We can have shabu-shabu Japanese hotpot or sushi with a chef in the dining area, or shisha water pipe at the rooftop, he shared. In fact, Tanaka himself is an ikebana Japanese floral arrangement instructor, who can arrange for sessions in the premises as well.",
      "The four-storey ryokan has only four rooms for up to a total of 12 occupants, so a stay there is both intimate and exclusive. But perhaps best of all is its excellent location. From the rooftop, you can easily spy the iconic Yasaka pagoda. And staying in the Ninenzaka area in central Kyoto means that youll have access to its rich mix of shops and cafes the area is best known for - including the famous Starbucks housed in a machiya merchant home.",
      "In fact, having access to some of the best Kyoto attractions and epic views is common with ryokans in the city. As businesses who have been around a long time, they are often strategic in their location, with access to either central Kyoto, a tranquil setting, or proximity to other choice sites.",
      "Just be sure of your priorities when looking for that best ryokan in Kyoto, as you wont likely be able to find them all in one. Do you need a Kyoto ryokan with private onsen baths? Would you require them to arrange for cultural experiences like a tea ceremony workshop or geisha female artist performance? Are beautiful Japanese garden views, like the ones in Yachiyo, important? Or is staying somewhere like Hirashin, so you can remain in the city centre, preferred?",
      "When looking for a ryokan as a Kyoto hotel stay, many think that it has to be an expensive affair. However, ryokans can actually cater to a variety of budgets, depending on their location, room types, and offerings.",
      "Fujiya, as mentioned, allows one to enjoy the traditional ambience with prices starting at just S50 per pax per room. Others like HOSHINOYA and Aman offer the most indulgent escapes with prices from S1,000 - S4,000. Oftentimes, this is because of the exclusivity accorded to their guests, along with unique experiences only the resorts provide.",
      "A stay in the luxurious HOSHINOYA Kyoto ryokan begins before you even reach the inn, with a tranquil chartered boat ride down the Katsura river. Image credit HOSHINOYA Kyoto",
      "Truly indulge in Kyotos breathtaking natural scenery at the HOSHINOYA ryokan, with luxury guest rooms having private balconies that overlook one of the citys rivers. Image credit HOSHINOYA Kyoto",
      "Visiting HOSHINOYA Kyoto itself is a picturesque journey, with a chartered river boat ride drifting you towards a private pier beside the historical building. The ryokan has an elegant outlook finished with local craftsman touches, and provides guest ryokan like monko - the art of incense appreciation. For Aman, their retreat provides a forested escape, as well guest-only indoor and open-air baths attached to a spa. The onsen baths at Aman also contain mineral hot spring water, nourishing your skin with every soak.",
      "Furnished with traditional tatami mats and simple decor, staying in a Kyoto ryokan like Hirashin gives you a chance to experience a slower, more relaxed side of Japanese culture. Image credit Morgan Awyong",
      "If youre planning to enjoy a relaxing day indoors at your ryokan in Kyoto, be sure to check if they offer some yummy afternoon tea or treats at no extra cost to satiate you until your next meal. Image credit Morgan Awyong",
      "To witness the festivities of Gion Matsuri Gion festival in 2023, I picked Hirashin for its location as it was just minutes away from the main streets of the parade. The Kyoto hotel was housed in a modern building rather than an actual inn, and offered an affordable no-frills city ryokan experience with traditional rooms starting from S120 a night. While there wasnt much of an epic view there were just neighbouring buildings, I enjoyed the daily sets of afternoon tea and treats brought to the room, as well as returning in the evening to my futon laid out. There was also a sento at the basement for guests to enjoy.",
      "If youre looking for a Kyoto ryokan with private onsen, then consider Yunohana Resort Suisen or Hanaikada. The first offers the luxury of being a secluded resort amidst mountains and forests, while the latter is perfectly situated at Arashiyama - known for its beautiful bamboo groves, riverside shops and forest temples.",
      "Even if youre not staying at a Kyoto onsen hotel, a visit to the local onsen is highly recommended to experience a slice of Japanese culture - while feeling rejuvenated after. I visited Hananoyu, but Sagano Tenzan-no-yu is also popular among visitors when looking for central Kyoto onsens.",
      "After a long day of visiting Kyotos most popular attractions, a trip to an onsen like Hananoyu is perfect for rejuvenating and recharging your energy. Image credit Morgan Awyong",
      "Dont worry if youve forgotten your bath essentials on your visit to Hananoyu onsen in Kyoto! Essential items including slippers and body lotion, as well as add-on services like massages, can be purchased from their convenient vending machines. Image credit Morgan Awyong",
      "At Hananoyu, I exchanged my shoes at a locker near the entrance with the provided slippers. There is a ticketing machine listing all the bath and body items you can purchase, including admission tickets to massage services, razors to body lotions. And dont worry if you cant read Japanese, the reception provides an English-language flyer that translates the text on the vending machine buttons.",
      "I paid S7 for my ticket and another S4 for a set of towels. I exchanged the ticket at the counter and was given my locker key. I was then directed to the onsen on the second floor, where large curtains indicated the male and female entrances.",
      "The rules of an onsen, whether in the form of indoor or open-air baths, are simple. You strip down and place all your items in the locker except for the small towel and your locker key, and shower thoroughly with the provided toiletries before getting into the pools. It is important that you do so to keep the natural waters clean. Admittedly, the idea of getting completely naked with strangers can be intimidating for some, but most of those who have been through it found it a liberating experience One small caveat - those with tattoos might face problems entering an onsen. Smaller ones can be covered with bandages but for anything larger than your palm, it is best to check with the onsen beforehand if entry is possible.",
      "Hananoyu boasted two outdoor soaking or rotenburo spots - one a more communal pool and two small open-air urn baths. Inside, there were more indoor baths with varying degrees to choose from. Theres no real order to follow, but it is recommended to start with the lower temperatures before moving to the hotter ones. There are bubble and jet baths for those who wish to soothe tired muscles, and a cold bath for after a sauna or steam room session. If you are using those two indoor bath rooms, be sure to dry off a bit before entering, and bring along the provided towels outside the rooms for sitting on. After the session and before the cold bath, make sure to wash off your perspiration from the lukewarm water in the urn as well. You can use your small towel, but remember - it should never touch the bath waters.",
      "After youve washed up from your bath in Kyotos Hananoyu onsen, take your relaxation one step further with a delicious meal at their in-house restaurant, or simply enjoy a moment of peace at their rest area. Image credit Morgan Awyong",
      "After you are thoroughly relaxed, head towards the shower to wash up again before towelling down with your large towel at the lockers. Afterwards, I chose to head down for a meal as Hananoyu had an in-house restaurant attached. The lobby itself also provided a large rest area with recliners, a small shopping area, and massage rooms. The nice hot meal after the soaks was an incredible way to end the day at one of the onsens in Kyoto.",

      "Because the world is too small for strangers. 29 Dec 2023 By Levi Cheng",
      "Rome stands as a living museum, inviting you to wander through its timeless neighbourhoods. Savour delectable cuisine, and soak in the artistry that adorns every corner. The city is vast and ancient, filled with so many archaeological monuments. It can honestly be a little intimidating, trying to figure out which attractions to visit and which fun things to try.",
      "Fret not, heres a list of must-see wonders and lesser-known sites in the Eternal City. Whether youre a new explorer or a seasoned visitor, there's always something new to do and see in Rome. Make sure to read to the end for some useful travel tips!",
      "A post shared by IgersRoma  Instagramers Roma igersroma",
      "You honestly cant say that youve visited Rome without seeing the Colosseum. The Roman Colosseum is one of the New Seven Wonders of the World and is one of the most popular sights in the city.",
      "This colossal amphitheatre, commissioned by Emperor Vespasian in AD 72, is a testament to the grandeur of Roman engineering and innovation. Its awe-inspiring structure once hosted gladiatorial contests and public spectacles, becoming a nexus for entertainment and political displays. Today, the Colosseum remains an enduring symbol of Rome's imperial past, offering visitors a tangible connection to the city's rich heritage. Stepping into the arena, one can almost feel the echoes of the past, envisioning the roaring crowds and the legendary battles that unfolded within its walls.",
      "The best time to visit is early in the morning on weekdays before the crowds start to form. Alternatively, a pro tip is to visit the Colosseum on a nighttime tour as the venue lights up and will be crowd-free. You can book tickets and packages from the official website that grants entry to various sections of the Colosseum, like the arena, underground area, or Bellevue area.",
      "Like most major tourist attractions in Rome, security is stringent at the Colosseum. You will not be allowed entry with large bags or luggages. It is recommended to pack light so that you can clear the security checks efficiently and spend more time touring the site.",
      "A post shared by ROMA - ROME , Italy - Travel  Food  Hotel noidiroma",
      "Next to the Colosseum lies the Palatine Hill, the tallest of seven hills that Rome is built on, housing the ruins of luxurious palaces that once housed emperors and aristocrats. Its significance is deeply intertwined with the foundation of Rome itself, as legend has it that this was the site where Romulus founded the city in 753 BC.",
      "Sitting just 40 metres below is the Roman Forum, a collection of magnificent historical buildings that were built in ancient Rome. The place is essentially the heart and origin of the Roman Empire thousands of years ago.",
      "The best part is that your Colosseum ticket grants entry to both popular attractions! You can also choose to join a guided tour as there are many stories to learn about while strolling through these historic sites. Be sure to bring along some sunscreen and plenty of fluids as the area can get quite sunny during the day.",
      "A post shared by Cassie cassherm",
      "The Pantheon is one of the few buildings from ancient Rome that has remained completely intact. Its iconic dome, an architectural marvel even by modern standards, is a testament to the ancient Romans' mastery of concrete construction.",
      "Visiting the Pantheon costs 5 S7.30 per adult, while those under 18 can still visit for free. However, dont let this deter you from visiting as the Pantheon is more than just a simple museum. Upon entering, you will quickly be taken in by the marvel of its architecture and opulence.",
      "We recommend booking your entrance tickets online to save time from queuing up for walk-in admissions. An audio guide will be included with your ticket, which can be downloaded on your phone.",
      "A post shared by Mrembo saravi_cr",
      "Another reason why a visit to the Pantheon shouldnt be skipped is because of its proximity to many other sights in Rome. Some of the must-sees include the Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, and Piazza Navona all of which are about seven minutes away from the Pantheon.",
      "The Spanish Steps consists of 138 steps and three unique terraces. Try climbing all the way up as the peak truly offers a beautiful view of your surroundings. However, avoid sitting down or eating whilst on the steps as you may be imposed with a 400 S584 fine! These laws have been implemented to protect the steps as it is a UNESCO World Heritage site.",
      "A post shared by Travelingmeworld travelingmeworld",
      "After spending time at the Spanish Steps, you can head west for the Trevi Fountain. It is the largest fountain in Rome, and definitely worth seeing. While here, you might see people throwing coins into the fountain. This is due to myths of the Trevi Fountain. It is said that if you throw one coin, you will return to Rome someday. If you throw two coins, you will find love in Rome. If you throw three coins, you will marry the person that you love. To achieve the desired effect of this myth, you should throw the coin with your right hand over your left shoulder.",
      "A post shared by Eitch / Borromini eitchborromini",
      "Moving on is Piazza Navona, the most spectacular square of Baroque Rome. Over the centuries, Piazza Navona has hosted many festivals, races, and rides. From beautiful churches to the three famous fountains, there is much to see. Day and night, Piazza Navona has a large merry-go-round of shops and restaurants. It is the perfect place to eat at and shop to your hearts desire!",
      "Since these locations are in open public spaces, you can visit them at any time during your holiday. Do pace yourself when visiting these locations, as crowds may get rather heavy during the midday and afternoon hours.",
      "Vatican City is nestled within Romes historic centre and is the worlds smallest sovereign state, led by the Pope. Whether you are seeking a deeper connection to your faith, or simply an immersive experience in art and history, the Vatican City State is the place to be.",
      "A post shared by Sightseeing Tours Italy sightseeingtoursitaly",
      "Standing proudly in the heart of Vatican City is Saint Peters Basilica, the most important Catholic church in the world. However, you dont have to be religious to visit this architectural marvel! Entry to the Basilica is free but the lines can be as impressive as the building itself. We recommend arriving by 700am to beat the crowds or take a guided tour, for a more comfortable experience. As a bonus, you can plan your trip with a Papal Audience on Wednesdays to see the Pope!",
      "As it is a holy venue, visitors to Saint Peters Basilica must be dressed appropriately or else you will be turned away at the door, regardless of how long youve been waiting.",
      "A post shared by Abhimanyu Singh Dhapola abhimanyudhapola",
      "Finally, a trip to Vatican City isnt complete without a tour of the Vatican Museums. The Vatican Museums are housed in a complex of buildings, showcasing some of the most renowned masterpieces in the world. You may need to set aside at least half a day to see the Vatican Museums due to how extensive it is.",
      "From the iconic frescoes of the Sistine Chapel, painted by the masterful hand of Michelangelo, to the Raphael Rooms and the Gallery of Maps, the Vatican Museums house an extraordinary array of masterpieces that span centuries. Beyond its artistic riches, the museums also hold cultural and historical significance as they provide a glimpse into the papal legacy and the Vatican's role in preserving and promoting art.",
      "Avoid visiting on Sundays as the museums are closed. However, the last Sunday of each month is a free entry day to the Vatican Museums. While the idea of free entry is tempting, we recommend avoiding it as the crowds will be even more massive.",
      "A post shared by Wilfer Guerrero warriorwilfer",
      "Located towards the end of the Vatican Museums, lies the Sistine Chapel. Michelangelo's awe-inspiring frescoes, notably the iconic ceiling and the Last Judgment, adorn the chapel's interior, creating an immersive experience that transcends time and space.",
      "Tickets for the museums will grant you access to the Chapel as well, however, there is no separate ticket for visiting the Chapel on its own. If you are short on time, following signs marked with Cappella Sistina Percorso Breve Sistine Chapel short route will allow you to beeline straight towards the Sistine Chapel after entering the Vatican Museums.",
      "Like Saint Peters Basilica, visitors must be appropriately dressed, or risk being denied entry. As of 2020, the Vatican Museums operate on shifts. This means that tickets are now timed, and you can go straight to the gate after booking your tickets online.",

      "With all the things to do and see in Rome, heres a handful of smart travel tips and tricks. As the saying goes when in Rome, do as the Romans do!",
      "Best time to visit The Eternal City of Rome is enchanting throughout the year, each season offering its unique charm. The ideal time for a visit is typically in the spring, from April to June, and in the fall, from September to October. These months are characterised by mild temperatures and fewer tourists, providing a more comfortable and intimate experience of the city's splendours. Summer in Rome, stretching from June to August, tends to be hot and is also the peak tourist season, making the city's famous sites more crowded. Winter, spanning from November to March, offers cooler weather and fewer crowds, ideal for those who prefer a more tranquil exploration of Rome's rich history and indoor tourist attractions.",
      "Currency The official currency in Italy is the euro . For convenient and hassle-free currency exchange, use Changi Recommends FX.

Additionally, tap-to-pay on your smartphone can be used for the metro.",
      "Reservations Romans love reservations, and restaurants tend to fill up quickly, especially in the evening. Try to call restaurants for a booking before visiting popular places to eat in Rome, or head there as soon as the shop opens for the best shot at getting a table.",
      "Most shops will accept card payment, but it is always handy to carry cash with you. The occasional restaurants, cafes and shops will only accept cash.",
      "Packing Walking around the citys many attractions can get exhausting, therefore it is important to be prepared! Bring along a water bottle in your day pack as drinking fountains that dispense potable water can be found throughout the city. Avoid bringing excessive and unnecessary gear to clear security checks faster when visiting attractions.",
      "Many of Romes famous sites such as the Sistine Chapel and Saint. Peters Basilica, require visitors to be appropriately dressed  meaning your shoulders, knees and chest should be covered. Wear comfortable shoes too as you will be walking around a lot.",
      "Other tips If possible, try to arrange for your accommodation to be near the Pantheon. This allows you to be in central Rome, granting easy access to places like Trevi Fountain, the Spanish Steps and Piazza Navona on foot. It also means that you can reach them early in the morning before the crowd!",
      "Lastly, be sure to always keep your valuables close and safe as pickpockets are not unheard of when visiting Rome. Check your belongings often and be vigilant! For an added peace of mind, remember to buy travel insurance before flying.",

Fortunately, its only a short 20-30-minute walk from the base to the peak, which means you dont necessarily have to wake up in the middle of the night just to make it for sunrise.",
      "If youre not confident of your navigation ability dont be, there are clearly marked trails!, there are tours available. Not only do they pick you up from your hotel, but Kawasan Waterfall is also included in the itinerary. That way, youre enjoying two sights in one trip.",
      "Cebus also well known for offering the chance to swim with majestic animals, such as thresher sharks and whale sharks.",
      "While the practice surrounding the latter is highly controversial and embroiled with ethical concerns, swimming with the former is considered fine. This is because Pelagic thresher sharks naturally visit the waters surrounding Malapascua Island all year round. Unlike with whale sharks, there are no artificial attraction methods such as feeding to lure the sharks closer.",
      "Its easy to spot them, with their distinctive long tail fin, but also because of how often theyd jump out of the water, not unlike a dolphin. Theyre also most active in the early morning.",
      "Depending on the time of the year, you might also get to see other marine animals, such as hammerhead sharks, manta rays, reef sharks or even banded sea snakes.",
      "While most of the dive spots are only open to those with diving certifications, there are some that are suitable for novicessuch as Whitetip Alley and Chocolate Oslandand youll still get to seek sharks.

      "The main feature of Kabutongan Falls is all its hidden caves behind the waterfall, as well as its multiple cliff jump pointsone is around 5 metres tall, while another is roughly 8-9 metres tall. The waters a shimmery turquoise that looks almost unreal. Soaking in it, surrounded by the sounds of nature all around you, really makes the experience something special.",
      "Getting there is half the fun too. The journey there involves hiking, trekking and even canyoneering to make it past the thickets and streams. Theres even a section that requires rope rappelling!",
      "According to past visitors, all that only takes half an hour. If youre worried about your physical ability or safety though, guides are available on site for hire.",
      "Entrance fee PHP100 S2.40 While Malapascua has thresher sharks, Moalboal has sardines!",
      "No one really knows for sure why such a huge school of sardines flock to such warm waters, but theyre here. Every day, they partake in a phenomenon called the sardine run. Its literally tonnes of fish swimming together and forming a giant ball of fish, we promise it looks a lot cooler than were making it sound.",
      "Thanks to the close proximity of the sardine ball to shore, you dont have to spend extra on renting a boat or a tour just to see them. All you need is a pair of goggles and swim out to view the sardine ball from above.",
      "If youve got scuba diving gear though, even better. The view of the sardine ball from below is even more impressive, with the way the light filters through the water and glints off the surface of the fish.",
      "If youre really lucky, you might even get the chance to swim alongside sea turtles and dolphins too! The best time of the year to go is between November and May, when the weathers the clearest and the water is the calmest.",
      "Maybe youd like to enjoy nature and wilderness in a more controlled setting, thats valid too! In that case, head on over to Cebu Safari and Adventure Park.",
      "Its located just 30 minutes from Danao city centre, making it a convenient one-day trip, especially for those travelling with kids. This safari is over 170 hectares large and is home to over a thousand animals from 120 different species. Tigers? Theyve got them. Meerkats? Theyre there too.",
      "Theres even a white lion safari, an African savanna experience and bird shows too! Kids would be particularly delighted to know theres a petting zoo, with goats, cows and ducks lined up at the ready for some loving.",
      "As for the adventure part of their name, the park has no shortage of adventure rides available. ATV rides, zip lines, sky bikes, aerial walks, zip coasters and even more are available. All youve got to be is daring enough to get down and dirty.",
      "Tickets are available for sale online, but children and senior citizen discounts are only available onsite.",
      "Address Barangay Corte, Toril, Carmen, 6005 Cebu, Philippines Opening hours 800am to 500pm",
      "If youd like nothing more than to just sit back and relax on the beach, then Sumilon Island is the best place to visit. Its a small little island just off the coast of Oslob with mad views, and far away from the crowds of Mactan beach.",
      "The water is remarkably clear, the sand is pristine whiteits the most picture-perfect, Instagram-ready beach youll find on your Cebu trip.",
      "Theres only one resort on this islandBluewater Resortsbut it offers both fancy resort stays and magical glamping experiences. You wont find yourself lacking for sure. By virtue of being the only resort on the island, they also provide day trips, snorkelling, fishing, paddling and other activities to keep you entertained.",
      "Otherwise, just lying on a towel and enjoying the sun, sand and sea is a pretty good way to spend time there. Its a holiday, after all, and holidays are for resting.",

      "Because the world is too small for strangers. 12 Dec 2023 By Valery Tan",
      "The capital of Cambodia, is not just a city to be seen but tasted an eclectic array of food dishes lies nestled amidst the architectural marvels and vibrant streetscapes of Phnom Penh.",
      "This revered destination invites travellers to embark on a culinary journey where history, culture, and flavour converge. At the heart of Cambodian meals is rice, served with an array of dishes that feature fresh herbs, aromatic spices, and a harmonious balance of sweet, sour, salty, and bitter tastes. Fish and seafood, sourced from the Mekong River and Tonle Sap Lake, are central to many dishes, with prahok, a fermented fish paste, adding a unique depth of flavor. The cuisine showcases a diverse range of noodle dishes, curries, and stews, often incorporating coconut milk for richness. Cambodian dishes are very similar to Thai cuisine, but contain much less chilli and sugar, and more aromatic spices.",
      "Lets take a look at the popular dishes in Cambodia which might just become your next favourite dish.",
      "Known for its simplicity and flavour, Bai Sach Chrouk pork and rice is a popular breakfast dish in Cambodia, particularly in Phnom Penh.",
      "It consists of pork that has been marinated in palm sugar and fish sauce, then grilled slowly over warm coals, giving it a distinctive smoky and sweet taste. The grilled pork is then thinly sliced and served over white rice.",
      "Accompanying the dish are pickled cucumbers and radish with ginger, adding a refreshing and tangy contrast to the savoury pork. A bowl of chicken broth, garnished with scallions and fried onions, is often served alongside to complete the meal.",
      "This breakfast staple is commonly found at street corners and is appreciated for its balanced, hearty, and flavourful characteristics, making it a must-try for anyone looking to explore the authentic culinary scene of Phnom Penh.",
      "Kuyteav, with its harmonious mix of herbs and meats submerged in a soul-warming broth, is a beloved and iconic breakfast choice in Phnom Penh.",
      "Originating from the Teochew Chinese, Kuyteav is a noodle soup made of rice noodles immersed in a clear, flavourful pork stock, adorned with an array of toppings. Its distinctiveness lies in the blend of savoury and slightly sweet undertones, creating a comforting and flavourful morning meal.",
      "Kuyteav can be enjoyed wet, with all ingredients immersed in the soup, or dry, where the soup is served on the side, akin to a noodle salad. The latter allows diners to dictate the flavour intensity, adding a personalised touch to the dining experience.",
      "Prefer a heavier breakfast? Nom Banhchok is your go-to Cambodian food then, with its lightly fermented rice noodles that are both satisfying and flavourful.",
      "Num Banhchok is celebrated for its variety. Different regions across Cambodia, you will find distinct versions of this beloved dish, each reflecting the local palate and available ingredients.",
      "For instance, Num Banhchok Samlor Proher is a classic variation featuring the signature rice noodles served in a flavourful broth, while Num Banhchok Kampot originates from Kampot and is known for its use of peanuts, dried shrimp, and the renowned Kampot fish sauce.",
      "The popularity of Num Banhchok isnt just restricted to its taste but is also woven into the cultural fabric of Cambodia through folklore.",
      "A popular Khmer folk legend narrates the story of Thon Chey, a revolutionary and scholar who made a living by making Num Banhchok in China after being exiled. The dishs popularity soared, capturing even the Chinese emperors attention.",
      "Those acquainted with the country's rich gastronomic landscape will point towards Samlor Korkor as Cambodia's true national dish.",
      "Samlor Korkor is known for its adaptability. Its recipe can incorporate a wide range of seasonal vegetables. The dish also isnt limited to a specific type of meat, but its typically made from pork belly and catfish. However, two ingredients central to Cambodian cuisine prahok fermented fish and kroeung curry pasteare always present, giving this food its distinctive taste. Toasted ground rice is also added to thicken the soup, offering a fuller texture and a subtle, nutty flavour. The rich and aromatic soup is often served alongside rice or rice noodles.",
      "As a lunch option, Samlor Korkor not only provides a hearty and nourishing meal but also showcases the depth and complexity of Cambodian culinary traditions.",
      "Amongst the citys street foods, Num Pang, a Cambodian sandwich reminiscent of the French baguette yet distinctly local in its fillings, stands as a testament to the citys culinary evolution. It features a short, crispy baguette with an airy texture, reminiscent of its French counterpart.",
      "The versatility of Num Pang is showcased in its diverse variations. Num Pang Pâté boasts a rich layer of pâté and cold cuts, complemented by mayonnaise, pickled carrots, radish, cucumbers, and fresh herbs.",
      "Num Pang Brahet is another popular variant, featuring pork meatballs amid a colourful mix of mayonnaise, pickled vegetables, salad, and herbs, a favourite in Siam Reap. For seafood enthusiasts, Num Pang Trey Khaw offers fish simmered in tomato sauce, harmoniously blended with mayonnaise, pickled carrots, papaya, cucumber, and fresh herbs.",
      "For those seeking to immerse themselves in the authentic Cambodian culinary landscape, consider the Kha Trei Svay Kchai that marries sweet, savoury, and sour in a dance of flavours.",
      "The main ingredients include fish steaks, palm sugar for caramelisation, garlic for an aromatic touch, and fish sauce to enhance the savoury notes. Red tomatoes are added to the mix, offering a hint of acidity and freshness, while ground black pepper lends a mild heat to the overall flavour.",
      "The dish is completed with a topping of sliced green mango, introducing a sour element that cuts through the sweetness of the palm sugar and the savoury notes of the fish sauce. The result is a balanced, flavourful salad dish that showcases the simplicity and elegance of Cambodian food.",
      "Central to this dish is prahok, a type of salty fermented fish that's a cornerstone in many Cambodian meals, known for adding an umami touch.",
      "In Prahok Ktis, the pronounced flavour of prahok is mellowed and enriched by a blend of coconut cream and palm sugar. Minced pork is also mixed in, lending the dish added substance and savouriness. The result is a creamy, flavourful dip that is a favourite among locals and visitors alike.",
      "Theres also a variant called Prahok Kroeung Ktis, where a spice paste made from roots adds another layer of aroma and taste to the mix. The dish balances the strong flavours and creates a richer taste profile.",
      "Prahok Ktis is typically served with an array of fresh, crunchy vegetables, offering a crisp, refreshing contrast to the creamy dip.",
      "Have it as a snack during teatime when those hunger pangs strike!",
      "For those unacquainted with Cambodian food, the sight of grilled stuffed frogs can be interesting. Yet, any reservations you have will be quickly dispelled upon the first bite.",
      "The outer layer, crisped to perfection, gives way to a juicy, flavourful interior where the medley of ingredients comes to life. The root spices lend an earthy depth, the chilies add a kick of heat, and the palm sugar imparts a delicate sweetness, making Kangkep Baob a balanced and delightful snack.",
      "You can easily find it at roadside barbecues all over Phnom Penh.",
      "Chrok Krao Chhnang is typically served with steamed rice. Literally translating to out of the pot, the distinctiveness of Chrok Krao Chhnang lies in its unique preparation, which you guessed it  out of the pot. The chef simply gathers all the ingredients in a container and pour the boiling water inside to make broth. Typically, the main ingredient is fish or anchovies, topped with boiled egg, tomatoes, cucumbers and shallots. The broth is then allowed to cool, before seasoning and fresh aromatic herbs are added. Some Cambodians even add ice to the broth and drink it cold. This dish is popular during Cambodias summer months of March and April.",
      "The Cambodians typically have the Kari Sach Moan during special occasions.",
      "Unlike the intense spice often associated with curries from neighbouring regions, Kari Sach Moan is characterised by its delightful mildness. The use of large local red chilies, known for their vibrant colour yet moderate heat, allows for a curry that is rich yet mellow, welcoming to a broad range of palates.",
      "Central to Kari Sach Moan is the chicken, tender and succulent, absorbing the medley of flavours infused in the curry.",
      "Prefer something light for dinner? Lort Cha consists of stir-fried short rice noodles, known as rice pin noodles. These noodles are akin to the Vietnamese Banh Bot Loc and the Mee Tai Mak popular in Singapore and Malaysia.",
      "Its a fuss-free and delicious dish where the noodles are stir fried with soya sauce, fish sauce, vegetables like bean sprouts and green onion, and typically beef, pork or chicken.",
      "Although simple, its a staple for the locals and a go-to for anytime of the day.",
      "Wrapping up this culinary exploration through Phnom Penh, it's evident that the city's diverse and exquisite cuisine is a direct reflection of its rich culture and history. As the capital, Phnom Penh is a melting pot of culinary traditions, providing an opportunity to savour local specialties and explore the nuances of Cambodian cuisine. And its vibrant street markets are probably one of the best ways to indulge in the unique and delectable offerings of Cambodian food!",
